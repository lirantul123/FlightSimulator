## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
You'll need Python 3 and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Server
On the machine that will host the game (or on your local machine for solo play), run the server:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
The server will listen on port 50007. For internet play, you'll need to port-forward this port.

### 3. Run the Game Client
Each player runs the main game:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
- In the settings screen, enter a callsign and the server's IP address.
- Select a plane and click "Start".
